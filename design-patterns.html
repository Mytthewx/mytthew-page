            Section 1: Design Patterns - what is it?

            1.1 Explain the definition of design patterns
        </span>
        <span class="section-definition">
            <strong>Design patterns</strong> are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern
            is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.
            <br>
            You can't just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or
            libraries. The pattern is not specific piece of code, but a general conecept for solving a particular
            problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own
            program.

            <p><strong>Singleton</strong> is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one
                instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.</p>
